# Manifesto

Make a supply of the results of Promises 

## Synopsis

A different version of the old 'sleep sort'

```perl6
use Manifesto;

my $manifesto = Manifesto.new;

for (^10).pick(*).map( -> $i { Promise.in($i).then({ $i })}) -> $p {
    $manifesto.add-promise($p);
}

my $channel = Channel.new;

react {
    whenever $manifesto -> $v {
        $channel.send: $v;
    }
    whenever $manifesto.empty {
        $channel.close;
        done;
    }
}

say $channel.list;

```

This manages a collection of Promise objects and a Supply which emits
the result of any when they are kept.
